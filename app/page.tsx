                          Hi, I'm Hayden Oâ€™Neill, a final-year Computer Science
                          student at Northumbria University, on track to
                          graduate with a first-class degree. With a strong
                          passion for technology and coding, I have developed
                          expertise in software engineering, web development,
                          and systems analysis, as well as many other aspects of
                          the industry. My academic achievements reflect my
                          dedication, having ranked jointly third in my second
                          year with an 82% average.
                        </Typography>
                        <Typography paragraph>
                          Beyond academics, I bring a well-rounded skill set
                          from my experiences in retail, hospitality, and sports
                          officiating. My roles as a basketball referee and
                          table official in high-profile leagues have sharpened
                          my ability to perform under pressure, communicate
                          effectively, and adapt to dynamic environments.

                      <>
                        <Typography paragraph>
                          Technically, I have experience working with multiple
                          programming languages, including Python, Java, C#, and
                          JavaScript, along with proficiency in many computing
                          aspects not limited to cloud computing, machine
                          learning, and data security. I thrive in collaborative
                          settings and enjoy solving complex problems with
                          innovative solutions.
                        </Typography>
                        <Typography paragraph>
                          I am eager to apply my technical expertise and
                          problem-solving skills in a fast-moving, tech-driven
                          environment. Whether it's software development, web
                          technologies, or data analysis, or something else
                          entirely, I am always looking for opportunities to
                          grow and create impactful solutions.
